# Acey Ducey
This is a simulation of the Acey Dcuey card game. Int the game, the dealer (the computer) deals
two cards face up. You have an option to bet or not to bet depending on whether or not
you feel the next card will have a value between the first two.

Your initial money is set to $100

The game keeps going until you lose all your money or interrupt the program.

The original program author was Bill Palmby of Prairie View, Illinois.
